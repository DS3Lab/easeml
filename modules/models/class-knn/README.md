# K Nearest Neighbor

Neighbors-based classification is a type of _instance-based_ learning or _non-generalizing_ learning: it does not attempt to construct a general internal model, but simply stores instances of the training data. Classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point.
